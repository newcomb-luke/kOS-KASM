# Built-In List

Please let me know if there is any built-in function of great importance that is missing from this list.

This is the list of (as of the current kOS version) common built-in functions that you can call.

Please note that any arguments that the function takes must be provided in sort of "opposite order".
If they take in a boolean as the first argument and an integer as the second, the integer would be pushed
first, and the boolean would be pushed last (so that it is on the top of the stack).
