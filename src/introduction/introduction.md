# Introduction

## What is KASM?

The Kerbal Assembler, KASM, is an assembler created for the popular Kerbal Space Program mod kOS.
The syntax is designed to be easy to understand and allow the user to write any code they could possibly write
in kOS's native language KerbalScript, but with more flexibility. It currently supports all kOS instructions and
the toolchain to create executable Kerbal Machine Code files or KSM files. It also has strong preprocessor support.
